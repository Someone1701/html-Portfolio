 <h3>Haikyu:The battle of Dumpsters</h3>
 <p>I love the anime and the characters.The storyline is great.</p>
 <h3>Demon Slayer:Infinity Castle</h3>
 <p>It has one of the best graphics and the fights were truly on next level when animated.</p>
 <h3>Blue Lock:Neo egoist league</h3>
 <p>The plot twists are on next level.<br>
    Mostly loved the ranking system of players conducting auctions and getting<br>
    pitched by some of the greatest teams which made the show interesting.</p>
